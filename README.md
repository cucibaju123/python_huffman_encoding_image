# HUFFMAN ENCODING WITH PYTHON

Encode or Decode txt file using huffman coding algorithm

[source](https://towardsdatascience.com/huffman-encoding-python-implementation-8448c3654328)

Packages:

- [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Bitstring](https://bitstring.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [SQLite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)

How to run:

- open command line terminal

- type: python ui.py

- if you have python2 and python3 installed use python3 ui.py

- fill in the txt file path

- You can either choose encode (for .txt file) or decode (for .bin file)

- If you choose encode, it will generate the encoded .bin file in the same directory as the input file

- If you choose decode, it will generate .txt file with the name of original input + \_decoded
